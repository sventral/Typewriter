# Typewriter

Typewriter is a single-page web app that recreates the feel of writing on a mechanical typewriter. The page canvas renders every keystroke, applies ink grain, and respects ruler and margin settings without any server component.

## Highlights
- Canvas-based typing stage with ruler guides, draggable margins, and zoom controls.
- Black, red, and erase inks with grain effects and adjustable opacity.
- Documents and settings persist automatically in browser storage, while the **Save** button downloads a snapshot of the current text.

## Run it locally
```bash
npm start
# Serves the project on http://localhost:8080
```

Any static file server (for example, `python -m http.server 8080`) can also host the app.

## Basic usage
1. Start a local server and open the site in a modern browser.
2. Click the paper to focus the stage and begin typing.
3. Use the toolbar to tweak fonts, margins, zoom, and ink options.
4. Press **Save** to download a text export; typing updates are saved to local storage automatically.
