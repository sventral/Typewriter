# Agent System Overview

This project currently ships as a static, client-side typewriter simulation and does **not** define an automated multi-agent system yet. All automation hooks, orchestration routines, and conversational entry points remain **TODO** items pending future work.

## Agent Directory
| Agent Name | Role | Entry Point | Config File |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | TODO: Define agent responsibilities. | TODO | TODO |

## Tools per Agent
- **TODO agent**
  - TODO: Enumerate supporting tools (module/function, input schema, output schema).

## Environment & Secrets
- No environment variables or secrets are currently required by the static front-end application.
- TODO: Document secrets once agents integrate with external services.

## Running Agents
- **Local:** TODO — no agent runtime defined yet.
- **Production:** TODO — deployment/hosting model for agents not established.

## Routing & Hand-off Rules
- TODO: Define how future agents will route tasks or hand off control.

## Safety & Permissions
- TODO: Establish safety boundaries, rate limits, and permission models when agents are introduced.

## Testing & Validation
- Manual smoke test: `python -m http.server 8080` (serves the static UI for manual verification).
- TODO: Add automated tests covering any future agent logic or integrations.

## Example Conversations
- TODO: Provide sample prompts/conversations once conversational agents exist.
