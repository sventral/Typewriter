# Repository Instructions

- Before creating a commit, run most appropriate tests to verify the website still loads, allows typing, and basic interactions work.
- If relevant, advise the user about which practical tests they should perform to check any modifications.
- Every change set must increment the visible version banner in `index.html` (`.app-version`) by increasing the numeric portion by 0.1 (e.g., `v.1.7b` â†’ `v.1.8b`).
